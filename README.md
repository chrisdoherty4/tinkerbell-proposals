# Proposals

The proposals repository exists to keep contributors and new people to the project up to speed
with project activity. Given our small community of contributors, our proposals process is
deliberately light weight. A light weight process lets us move quickly while still highlighting
key details for the community.

To create a proposal, raise an issue in this repository with pieces from the template below
that are relevant for your proposal.

If you wish to see proposals prior to the change in process you can check out commit 
[28ad00608c176871a57d5a5519d9a3f4b9d1cf98](https://github.com/tinkerbell/proposals/commit/28ad00608c176871a57d5a5519d9a3f4b9d1cf98).

# Title

## Context

Describe background detail necessary to appreciate the changes you're proposing to help readers
orient.

## Goals/Non-goals

Consider succinctly describing (a few sentences) what you will achieve with this proposal. You
may wish to call out some specific non-goals also.

## Proposal

Start by summarizing your changes at a high level in a way that compliments the context already
laid out.

Then dive in a little deeper using diagramming as necessary to clarify specifics. Typically
boundaries require additional information to help readers understand what contracts look like.
For example, what does the contract between 2 services look like? What technology/protocol will 
they use?

## Rationale

Summarise alternatives that were considered and elaborate on why they are unsatisfactory by
comparison. There is significant value in portraying options to readers so they can weigh
up pros and cons. It can be difficul to generate alternatives but that shouldn't be used as a
reason to avoid it so do think carefully before removing this section.
