To understand the proposal's workflow, you should read the proposal
number [001](https://github.com/tinkerbell/proposals/blob/main/proposals/0001/README.md).

In there, you will find all the information required to write your own one or to
understand how far a current proposal is far from being published, aborted or
resolved (committed).

I hope to see one from you and feel free to collaborate with us leaving your
comment on currently open proposals.
