Welcome to the Tinkerbell Project's Proposals Repo!

This is the place where we discuss and decide upon "big" changes to the Tinkerbell project.

Pending Proposals are those that are still [open](https://github.com/tinkerbell/proposals/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc), maybe you'd like to check them out?
Accepted proposals are those that have been [merged](https://github.com/tinkerbell/proposals/pulls?q=is%3Apr+sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Amerged).
Abandonded proposals are those that have [closed](https://github.com/tinkerbell/proposals/pulls?q=is%3Apr+sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Aclosed+is%3Aunmerged).

If you'd like to create a proposal all you need to do is run the [new.sh](./scripts/new.sh) script.
Do not edit the `id: ID` header, that will be handled later.
Change the status to the most appropriate value, most likely `ideation`.
The file created in `proposals/new/README.md` will have in-line content to help explain each section, replace this with your proposal content.
Open up a Pull Request once you are ready to submit for review/discussion.
Then assign the PR number to your proposal by running the [number.sh](./scripts/number.sh) script.
Squashing this change into the previous commit is *highly* recommended.
