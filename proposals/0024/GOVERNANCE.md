# Governance

This document describes how the Liberal contribution governance structure is implemented in the Tinkerbell community.

## What is Liberal contribution?

Under a liberal contribution model, the people who do the most work [in the prescribed way] are recognized as most influential, but this is based on current work and not historic contributions.
Major project decisions are made based on a consensus seeking process (discuss major grievances) rather than pure vote, and strive to include as many community perspectives as possible.
Popular examples of projects that use a liberal contribution model include Node.js and Rust <sup>[1]</sup>.

## Community Roles

This doc outlines the various roles in the Tinkerbell community.

One of the overarching goals of having different roles in the community is to make sure to "allow good changes to enter the code with a minimum of fuss"<sup>[2]</sup>.
The following criteria is to be used when considering and individual for a role.

- a pattern of good judgement in regard to the code bases and to oneself
- demonstrated history of "playing nice" in the community
- amount and consistency of contributions and activity
