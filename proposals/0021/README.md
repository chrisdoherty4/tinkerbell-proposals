## Summary

This proposal is about having a hub for "certified" and reusable actions.
It will run on `actions.tinkerbell.org` and I pictured it as a read only
registry with a static site.

## Goals and not Goals

Goal:
1. Define goals and requirement for the Action Hub
2. Explain how we can implement the Action Hub MVP

No-Goal:

1. I don't want to define what `certified` means
