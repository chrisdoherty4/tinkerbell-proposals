### Table of contents

This is what the table of contents for a Proposal should look like:

1. Summary
2. Goals and non-goals
3. Content

## Summary

An unspoken desire of some in the community is that we continue to improve and grow our vibrant and close knit community.
Some updates to our bi-weekly meeting could help contribute to this desire.
Some other updates to be more attentive and more promptly address issue and PR in individual repositories would help as well.

## Goals and non-Goals

The goal of this proposal is to encourage more engagement, productivity, and cultivate a greater sense of togetherness in the bi-weekly community meeting.
